# Hjernebyggesettet - Web 
_A neural network simulator written in javascript for the web._


## Getting started

To develop you will need [NodeJS + npm](https://nodejs.org/en/), [git](https://git-scm.com/) and a decent code editor (I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).

### Install dependencies

To install the dependencies, navigate to the project directory with your shell and run `npm install`.

### Develop

To start a local development server, run `npm start`.

### Build

Building the app is done with `npm run build`. This will result in a .html, .css and .js file in the `dist` directory of the project.

## Continous delivery

This project uses continous delivery through TravisCI and Github Pages. The latest commit in the master branch is automatically built and hosted at https://hjernebyggesettet.github.io.
